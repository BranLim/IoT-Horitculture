This repository contains the implementation of a soil moisture monitoring program meant for the Arduino.

It requires the Arduino_SensorKit library and the following hardware:
1.  Buzzer
2.  OLED display (SSD1315)

For the display to work on Arduino Uno, you will need use software I2C instead of hardware I2C.
